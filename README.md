# Non-Blocking Multi-Client HTTP Server

## Overview  
This project implements a lightweight **non-blocking HTTP server** that supports multiple clients using `select()`. It is designed to handle various HTTP methods efficiently without multi-threading.  

## Features  
- âœ… **Non-blocking I/O** â€“ Uses `select()` to manage multiple connections efficiently.  
- âœ… **HTTP Method Support** â€“ Implements `OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE`.  
- âœ… **Multi-Language Support** â€“ Handles `lang` query string (`en`, `he`, `fr`) to serve localized pages.  
- âœ… **Request Handling** â€“ `POST` requests log received data to the console.  
- âœ… **Persistent & Timeout Management** â€“ Closes inactive connections after **2 minutes** of inactivity.  

## Implementation Highlights  
- ðŸ”¹ Uses **event-driven programming** instead of threads.  
- ðŸ”¹ Implements **HTTP parsing and response generation** from scratch.  
- ðŸ”¹ Designed to support **real-time debugging and monitoring** via Wireshark.  
- ðŸ”¹ Ensures **efficient resource management** by closing inactive connections.
